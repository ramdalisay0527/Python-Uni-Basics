# B3 coordinates is (0.5, 1)
# 1y 24 = 12, 11.5
# (coordinate minus 1) * .5 = coordinate number
# coordinateso of the problem  (1,0.5) (0.5,2) (12,12)
#import math library because you need square root
#sqrt((1-0.5)*(1-0.5)+(0.5-2)*(0.5-2))
#use str1 = 'B25' , str1[0], str[1:3] to extract key and value
